# Tic-Tac-Toe using sockets!

I'm learning sockets at university, so I decided to make this. It can probably be optimized (I'm sure it can), but it's what I have based on my current knowledge.

# How to play
host:
```
./tic_tac_toe -h
```

client:
```
./tic_tac_toe -c
or
./tic_tac_toe -c -i <ip>
```

#### Some important notes:
- The Makefile, memory.c/h, and debug.c/h files are not mine; they were provided and created by [IPLeiria](https://www.ipleiria.pt/) teachers. I just used those files as a habit.
